                    <li>Fluffy examples are bad. Reduce noise, uneeded steps</li>
                    <li>Non descriptive and inacurate Scenario title. Title should describe an activity/task and should detail how this is different</li>
                    <li>Too much of "i" blurs context</li>
                    <li>When after Then is an anomaly. Examples should be independent</li>
