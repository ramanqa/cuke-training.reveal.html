            <pre><code class='gherkin'>Feature: Account Holder withdraws money from ATM

  As an Account Holder
  I want to withdraw cash from an ATM
  So that I can get money when bank is closed

  Example: Account holder can withdraw cash when account has
     sufficient funds
    Given account balance is Rs.100
    Given ATM card is valid
    Given ATM machine has more than Rs.100 in cash
    When Account Holder requests Rs.50
    Then ATM machine dispeses Rs.50
    Then ATM card is returned
    Then new account balance is Rs.50

  Example: Account holder can not withdraw cash when account has
     insufficient funds
    Given account balance is Rs.10
    Given ATM card is valid
    Given ATM machine has more than Rs.100 in cash
    When Account Holder requests Rs.50
    Then ATM machine does not dispense money
    Then ATM card is returned
    Then ATM machine shows error message 'insufficient
      account balance'
    Then new account balance is Rs.10

  Example: Account holder can not withdraw cash when ATM card has
     expired
    Given account balance is Rs.100
    Given ATM card has expired
    Given ATM machine has more than Rs.100 in cash
    When Account Holder requests Rs.50
    Then ATM machine does not dispense money
    Then ATM card is returned
    Then ATM machine shows error message 'ATM card expired'
    Then new account balance is Rs.100
